# 👋 Hi, I'm Sahar Batool

I'm a **Mobile Application Developer** who crafts clean, modern, and scalable Android apps — blending the power of **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **Firebase** with automation and cloud tools like **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **AWS**.

I thrive at the intersection of mobile development and DevOps. Whether it's building user-centric interfaces or automating CI/CD pipelines, I focus on delivering smooth user experiences and robust backend integrations.

- 🚀 Build Android apps with modern architecture & UI (Jetpack Compose, MVVM)
- 🔌 Integrate real-time services using Firebase, REST APIs, and Google APIs
- 🧠 Enhance app functionality with ML Kit, NFC, in-app purchases, and AdMob
- 🛠️ Automate build & release cycles using GitHub Actions and Firebase App Distribution
- ☁️ Optimize cloud-based infrastructure using AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), Docker & Jenkins
